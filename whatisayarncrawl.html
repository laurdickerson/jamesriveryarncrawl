        <h1> What is a Yarn Crawl &amp; other FAQs</h1>
        <h2> What is a Yarn Crawl?</h2> 
        <p>We’re glad you asked! A Yarn Crawl is a trip to see several local yarn shops. In our case, we’ll be visiting local yarn shops all along the James River, tracting the path of this mighty river through Virginia. </p>
        <h2>Are there special prizes for visiting each shop?</h2>
        <p>You’d better believe it! We’ll be handing out passports that you can stamp at each shop. If you fill out every slot on your passport, you get a special surprise for making it to the end!</p>
        <h2>How can I participate?</h2>
        <p>Come visit each shop along the way. We’ll be giving away prizes, hanging out and knitting, and celebrating our fiber community across Virginia!</p>
        <h2>What else do I need to know?</h2>
        <p>That’ll do it for now! check back here as we keep developing our plans &amp; we’ll keep you posted! </p>
